I am currently a Master student majoring in Computer Technology at ZJU-UIUC Joint Institute, Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. [Hongwei Wang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/hwang).

My research interests lie at Trustworthy Machine Learning, Deep Learning based Fault Diagnosis. I consistently seek simple yet effective methods, grounded in deep insights and supported by strong theoretical foundations.
